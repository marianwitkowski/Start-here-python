**Event Processing**

#Objectives
These sample will demonstrate how to receive events and send email using Live Objects event processing and "event to action" capabilities. 


#Samples
You will find in this project 2 main classes illustrating this sample:

- Create the rules and the email action : **CreateRule**
- Consume event fired by Live Object : **EventConsumer**


#Building the sample
The project is a maven project. You are free to use any IDE of your choice to build the project.


#Prepare to use the sample
1. Create a device named device1 in Live Objects or use the auto provisioning capabilities of live objects

2. You can either create your matching, firing rule and event to action by hand using postman, or just run the java utility **CreateRule** provided.

##Using postman collection
Create the matching, firing rule and actionPolicy (you can do it by yourself (see the developer guide))


##Using the sample

- Set The API_KEY and the email to use to receive the event and run the **createRule** sample 
- You can list the matching rule, firing rule and actionPolicy created using the Swagger tool from the Live Objects environment.

- To consume the event fired, use the **EventConsumer** sample. Your program is now waiting for a fired event.

- Send data from your device : If you are using the matching rule given here, you can use directly the sample from github https://github.com/DatavenueLiveObjects/Start-here-java/tree/master/Data%20management/Publish%20data%20in%20device%20mode to send temperature and humidity values that will fire the event.

- In the console of the EventConsumer you should see the event received:
Received message from Topic  router/~event/v1/data/eventprocessing/fired ....
- In your mailBox, you will find the email corresponding to the fired event
