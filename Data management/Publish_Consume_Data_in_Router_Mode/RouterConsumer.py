#  Application connects to LO and consumes messages from a Router topic.
#  *
#  * if you launch multiple instances you will notice that all messages sent are delivered to all instances
#  *  but your consumer(s) should be running when the messages are published to Live Objects, else they won't be consumed.
#  *  If you need to be able to consume data after they have been published, use the fifo mode to consume them.
